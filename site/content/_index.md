  heading: Why Lepaco
  text: >-
    Lepaco started as a niche brand of ”Made in Vietnam” baby clothes. Made of
    ”eco-friendly” cotton, their soft feel and innovative designs immediately
    won customers from all around the world. Manufactured in two sizes; baby and
    full-size, the line grew to twenty-six designs and products would routinely
    sell out. Fairly early on, Founder and CEO Miss Mia and Mr Bin realized that
    in order to grow their audience and drive traffic to the store, she would
    need to source the best quality materials for their customers.

  heading: Our values
  text: >-
    Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
    of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We
    want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
